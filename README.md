# LFD_CNN_Transfer-Learning
CNN model with data augmentation and the same model using Transfer Learning to compare their performance
I developed a CNN model from scratch with data augmentation for image
classification and the same model using transfer learning to compare
their performance using Python.
The model from scratch with data augmentation shows 82% accuracy in
training data and 71% in test data after 20 epochs.
Train this same model using transfer learning; after only five epochs, I get
93% accuracy on training data and 87% on test data.
